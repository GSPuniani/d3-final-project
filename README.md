ACS 4310: Final Project

This is the final project for ACS 4310: Data Visualizations & Web Graphics. This project uses D3.js to create three data visualizations based on (this Kaggle dataset)[https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/company-acquisitions-7-top-companies] containing data on mergers and acquisitions in the tech industry in the past several decades. The three visualizations are as follows:
  - Bar graph dislaying total number of acquisitions for each of the major parent companies over the whole time frame
  - Bar graph displaying total number of acquisitions for each month in a given year (selected by user with a dropdown menu)
  - Connected scatter plot displaying total number of acquisitions for each year
